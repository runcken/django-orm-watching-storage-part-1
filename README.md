# Bank security console

This is internal repository for bank employees. If you got into this repository by accident, you will not be able to run it, because you dont have access to the database, but you will be able to freely use the code or see how the database queries are implemented.

Security console is a website that can be connected to a remote database with visits and passcards of our bank employees.

## How to install

To avoid problems with installing required additinal packages, use a virtual environment.

Python3.12 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers dvmn.org.
